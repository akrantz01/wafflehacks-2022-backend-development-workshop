# Full Stack Workshop
###### Presented at 12pm on June 18th, 2022 (EDT)

Learn how to quickly plan, build, and deploy a backend in Python using Flask, and then integrate it with a React frontend.
In this workshop you will learn to create a todo list webapp complete with lists and tags.

**Note**: This workshop will NOT teach you how to build the frontend. We will just be connecting the frontend to the backend.
